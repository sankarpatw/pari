**[PARI](https://ruralindiaonline.org/)** is a digital journalism platform in India, founded by veteran journalist and former rural affairs editor of 'The Hindu', **Palagummi Sainath**. **PARI** is a volunteer-run rural journalism platform.

## Development setup

To start with local development setup, clone both pari.git and pari-ansible.git repositories in a directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari.git
$ git clone https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari-ansible.git
```

Make sure you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) installed in your machine.
Also make sure you have internet connectivity. Then, you can get the vagrant box up and provisioned by:

```sh
$ cd pari
$ vagrant up   # This would take a while to complete. You'll be prompted for SUDO password of your host machine for the first time.
```

Once after the initial provisioning is completed, local development instance of PARI can be accessed in the browser. 

    # To access home page
    
    http://development.ruralindiaonline.org/
             
    # To access admin console
    # Username: pari
    # Password: !abcd1234
    
    http://development.ruralindiaonline.org/admin/

Few basic commands to help development,

```sh
$ vagrant ssh                                   # Login to vagrant box
$ cd /vagrant && source pari_env/bin/activate   # Change to project directory and activate project virtualenv   
$ python manage.py shell                        # Access django shell
$ python manage.py dbshell                      # Access postgres DB. Password: pari
$ python manage.py test --keepdb                # Run all the tests
$ deactivate                                    # Exit from project virtualenv
```
